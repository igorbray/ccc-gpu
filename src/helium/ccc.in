This is the same input file for both CCC and CCO. Here are a few comments
for some of the parameters. 
ENERGY is the projectile energy in eV
NZNUC  is the Z of the nucleus
ZASYM  is the asymptotic charge of the atom/ion
NZE    is the charge on the projectile, -1 for electrons and 1 for positrons
NINC   is the principal quantum number of the incident target state
LINC   is the angular momentum quantum number of the incident target state
LABOT  is the starting value of orbital angular momentum of the target states
LATOP  is the ending value of orbital angular momentum of the target states
NABOT(l)  is the starting principle quantum number for a particular l
NATOP(l)  if positive, is the ending principle quantum number for the
       corresponding l. If negative, then only open channels will be used.
       If zero then all of the states generated with NPS below will be used
NTST   is 0 for both discrete and continuum states in the optical potential
       is 1 for only discrete states and 2 for only continuum states
NUNIT  is 1 for the totalcs file having cross sections in a0**2,
       is 2 for the totalcs file having cross sections in pi a0**2, and
       is 3 for the totalcs file having cross sections in cm**2
       is 0 for this file not being created
NNBTOP principle quantum number of eigenstates used to form the overlap
       with the pseudostates. Also used for CCO when NTST = 0 or 1
LTTOP  max value of l in the optical potential
NCSTATES is the number of integration points in the continuum (CCO only)
LSTART Starting value of LG = J, the total orbital angular momentum
LSTOP  Last value of LG = J, the total orbital angular momentum
IPAR   0 for natural parity and 1 for unnatural parity
NENT   Number of incident channels for which the data is to be calculated
NPTOP  is the principle quantum number of P space state with optical potential
LPTOP  is the corresponding l
NPS(l) The size of the Laguerre basis is NPS(l) - l
ALPHA(l)  is the corresponding exponential fall-off factor
N, L   used to define the distorting potential. Set to 0, 0 for plane waves
IFIRST is 0 for direct only and 1 with exchange
ISECOND is < 0 for no optical potentials
NOLD   0 for exact states, 1 for pseudostates
THETA  0.0 for old form of equations, > 0.0 (typically 1.0) for new form
ALPHA(l)  lambda = alpha * 2.0, is the fall off of laguerre basis
ITAIL  1 for tail integral, 0 for none
QCUT   largest value of k such that sin(k*r) can be integrated reliably
RMAX   largest value of r
10,3,24,0.2,12,2.0,4,4.0   LSW, NINT, K grid parameters
K grid parameters as above imply 12 points within 0.2 of the on-shell point,
       extra 24 points spread between 0.0 and 2.0, and 4 points after 2.0 with
       a transformation that assumes fall off as 1/k**4.0. This is until
       total orbital angular momentum LG = LSW = 10.
15,3,10,-0.5,20,2.0,4,4.0   LSW, NINT, K grid parameters
K grid parameters as above imply 20 points from zero to about 2 * 0.5,
       extra 10 points spread between 2 * 0.5 and 2.0, and 4 points after 2.0 
       with a transformation that assumes fall off as 1/k**4.0. This is until
       total orbital angular momentum LG = LSW = 15.
LSW    is used to indicate at what value of LG a new set of kgrid 
       parameters will be used. Last value of LSW must be > LSTOP.
